# üåÆTaco Rank

A personal and fun Python project where I rank and review taco places in Chicago, using what I've learned and adding my own creativity.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- Python: Lists, dictionaries, lambda functions, and iteration
- GitHub: Version control and GitHub Actions (planned)
- Linux Environments: Arch Linux and Ubuntu for personal learning and practice
- Developed during personal time outside of work responsibilities (such as lunch breaks) on a MacBook Air (Latin School of Chicago work computer), to maximize productivity and practice real-world applications.


---

## üìà Current Features
- Store taco place information (name, recommended menu, score, personal comments)
- Sort and rank taco places based on score
- Display favorite taco places based on personal rankings

---

## üß© Automation (Planned)
- Plan to greet new contributors automatically when they open an issue or pull request
- Plan to automatically add a "review needed" label to new pull requests
- Future plan: Merge and display contributor taco ratings and comments alongside my own

---

## üöÄ Next Steps
- Build a contributor taco reviews collection workflow
- Create a Jira board to track project errors, plans, and problem-solving progress
- Merge contributor comments with my reviews for a community-driven taco ranking
- Build a simple dashboard or summary report to show combined scores
- Expand to more cities and different taco styles
- Keep improving automation workflows as I keep learning

## ‚ú® Why This Project?
Instead of just practicing Python and GitHub in a typical way, I wanted to make it more fun and personal.  
Ranking taco places felt like the perfect way to add creativity to what I was learning.  

Rather than doing a basic project like a to-do list, I made something that keeps me engaged, shows my style, and helps me apply what I'm learning in real ways.

This project shows my mindset to grow, try new ideas, and build things that are real to me while still learning the foundations.
