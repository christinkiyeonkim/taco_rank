# ðŸŒ® Taco Place Ranking in Chicago

A personal project using Python to rank my favorite taco spots in Chicago.  
Sorted by my taste preferences and includes my honest recommendations.  

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used:
- Python lists & dictionaries
- `sorted()` with lambda
- List iteration and formatted output


# ðŸš€ First time pushing to Git from my work computer (MacBook Air from Latin School).
# ðŸ’» I usually work on Arch Linux or Ubuntu.


## ðŸš€ Next Steps / Upcoming Plans

- Implement GitHub Actions automation to collect taco ratings from contributors.
- Merge contributor comments with my own reviews for a community-driven taco ranking system.
- Build a simple dashboard or summary report to display the combined scores.
- Expand the project to cover more cities and taco styles.
- Continue improving workflow automation as I progress in my learning journey.
